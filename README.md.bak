# RDI Challenge

RDI Challenge is a test project that I found on the internet for a job opportunity and developed the code to meet the requirements. It is developed using .NET Core 3.1 and follows the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architectural pattern. The project utilizes RabbitMQ version 6.2.1 for messaging and NUnit for unit testing. The API documentation is done using Swagger.

## Technologies Used

- .NET Core 3.1
- RabbitMQ 6.2.1
- NUnit

## Testing

The project uses NUnit for unit testing. To run the tests, follow these steps:
